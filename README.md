# Sinatra file upload progress demo

### Introduction
This is a demonstration of a file upload progress bar using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [jquery upload progress](https://github.com/drogus/jquery-upload-progress).
If you want to use this with nginx and passenger you may check the instructions at my [blog](http://blog.pedrocarrico.net/post/22862870712/installing-nginx-with-passenger-and) and grab the sample configuration included in this project.
